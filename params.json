  "body": "### How to use\r\n\r\nFirst, include the stylesheet at the top of your page.\r\n\r\n```html\r\n<link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"path/to/tippy.min.css\">\r\n```\r\n\r\nFor the simplest case, add the property `data-tippy` to an element with your tooltip text as the value. You can do this to links, spans, divs, and even buttons. (Well, in most browsers. We'll get to that.)\r\n\r\n```html\r\n<button data-tippy=\"I am a tooltip!\">...</button>\r\n<a href=\"http://www.google.com\" data-tippy=\"Link to Google\">...</a>\r\n<span data-tippy=\"Hello world\">...</span>\r\n<div data-tippy=\"Full width element\">...</div>\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Tooltip positions\r\n\r\nBy default, tooltips appear below the element to which they belong. By including the `data-tippy-pos` property, you can control how they appear. There are four potential values: \"up\", \"down\", \"left\", and \"right\".\r\n\r\n```html\r\n<button data-tippy=\"I am a tooltip!\" data-tippy-pos=\"up\">\r\n<button data-tippy=\"I am a tooltip!\" data-tippy-pos=\"down\">\r\n<button data-tippy=\"I am a tooltip!\" data-tippy-pos=\"left\">\r\n<button data-tippy=\"I am a tooltip!\" data-tippy-pos=\"right\">\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Special animations\r\n\r\nThe tooltips don't have much by way of default animation. They fade in, but that's it. There are two optional animation types, however. Include the `data-tippy-animate` property and one of two values, \"slide\" or \"bubble\".\r\n\r\n### Browser support\r\n\r\nTippy.css has been tested in Internet Explorer 9-11 and the latest versions of Chrome, Firefox, Edge (yay Windows 10 Insider program), and Vivaldi (my browser of choice).\r\n\r\n### Known issues\r\n\r\n* Tooltips are created by using the `::before` and `::after` pseudo-elements, so tooltips on any element that doesn't have those, like images or input fields, won't appear.\r\n\r\n You can work around this by wrapping the element in a span or a div, though, like this:\r\n\r\n ```html\r\n <div data-tippy=\"Super awesome picture\">\r\n    <img src=\"cats-rule.jpg\">\r\n </div>\r\n```\r\n\r\n* If your stylesheet is using pseudo-elements on certain elements, you will run into conflicts. This will result in weird behavior or non-working tooltips.\r\n\r\n* HTML inside tooltips will not work, so don't even try.\r\n\r\n* Tooltips don't work on `<button>` elements in Internet Explorer or Edge. I don't know why. :/\r\n\r\n### License\r\n\r\nTippy.css has been released under the [MIT license](LICENSE).\r\n",
